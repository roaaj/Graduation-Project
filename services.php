                        <h6>What are the delivery charges?</h6>
                        We offer free delivery on all direct orders, irrespective of price, size, or destination of the goods.
                        <h6>If I order different items in a single transaction, will they be delivered in a single package or separate packages?</h6>
                        We encourage sellers to submit their orders as soon as possible.
                        Since there are different sellers in different locations,
                        we collect all the books in our processing centre to ship all the books at the same time,
                        and This means that the order will deliver the books to you in one shipment; if sent from the same country.
